-- RD-1 / RD-2 (MF-5) regression: non-PK qual pushdown + Pass2 orphan emission.
--
-- Background
--   The BranchScan merge runs in two passes:
--     Pass1 : SPI-scan MAIN (optionally filtered by the pushed-down WHERE
--             fragment, custom_private[5] `general_where_sql`) and overlay
--             each MAIN row with a bsearch in the delta list by key.
--     Pass2 : emit every delta row that Pass1 did NOT match, i.e. the
--             "orphans" — pure-delta INSERTs and UPDATEs whose MAIN row no
--             longer satisfies the pushed WHERE fragment (moved into the
--             queried set), after re-checking the qualifier on the
--             reconstructed overlay tuple.
--
--   RD-1 and RD-2 were two O(M^2) "latest-wins" folds that were only ever
--   reachable when two delta rows could share a key.  `pg_branch_delta` is
--   keyed PRIMARY KEY (branch_id, relid, key) and the scan loads a list with
--   an exact (branch_id, relid) filter, so keys are structurally unique and
--   both folds degenerated to identity while costing O(M^2) per scan.  They
--   were deleted.  A *more* selective pushdown shrinks Pass1's match set and
--   pushes more overlays into the Pass2 orphan path, which is what made the
--   old fold cost blow up (the observed MF-5 symptom: a selective non-PK
--   predicate was SLOWER than no predicate at all).
--
-- What this test pins
--   1. Correctness of the non-PK pushdown + Pass2 orphan path: results must
--      not lose or duplicate any row when the predicate is pushed down and
--      Pass1's match set shrinks (up to the extreme where Pass1 matches
--      nothing and every delta row is an orphan).
--   2. The structural premise that made the RD-1/RD-2 folds removable — delta
--      keys are unique per (branch_id, relid).  If a future schema change
--      drops that PK the removals become unsafe and this assertion fails.
--
-- Fixture
--   ob_pd(id PK, grp, payload); 200 MAIN rows, grp = (id-1)/20 (0..9),
--   payload = 'm'||id.  The branch then edits grp=7 (ids 141..160) with all
--   four op shapes:
--     - DELETE 141..145      (MAIN match, dropped from grp=7)
--     - UPDATE 146..150      (MAIN match, in-place overlay)
--     - UPDATE 156..160 -> grp=8 (MAIN match for grp=8, dropped from grp=7)
--     - UPDATE 1..5     -> grp=7 (orphan, moved INTO the queried set)
--     - INSERT 201..205      (orphan, pure delta)
--   Expected grp=7 set = {1..5, 146..155, 201..205} = 20 rows.
--
--   Plan-shape probing goes through a DO block with SPI EXECUTE because the
--   A7 gate rejects DDL (including CREATE TEMP TABLE) while a branch is
--   active; all DDL here runs before use_branch / after discard_branch.
